what if I told you that you could charge
0:01
local businesses $2 to $33,000 setup
0:03
fees plus
0:05
$497 per month selling websites but
0:08
these aren't your basic websites that
0:09
most businesses already have these
0:11
websites combine Ai and automation to
0:13
actually rank on Google generate
0:15
consistent leads and nurture those leads
0:17
into customers for your clients I like
0:19
to call this new type of website a smart
0:21
website so in this video I'll show you
0:23
exactly how to build and sell these
0:25
smart websites so you can do the same
0:27
thing making incredible money online and
0:29
helping local businesses in the process
0:31
but first what even is a smart website
0:33
to answer that let's look at your basic
0:35
everyday website first all right so I've
0:37
got Google Maps pulled up here and I
0:38
typed in landscaping near me first
0:40
company that's ranked number one doesn't
0:42
even have a website second company
0:44
doesn't have a website third company has
0:46
a website let's check it out oh it's
0:49
just a Facebook page it's not a real
0:50
website um let's click on like this one
0:53
for example all right so we found one
0:55
that has a website finally First Look is
0:57
the SEO any good typically if a company
1:01
only has four pages on their website
1:03
their SEO is not going to be very good
1:05
now you still can have decent SEO with a
1:07
four-page website but um they're
1:09
definitely not optimized for SEO as you
1:11
can see here um and typically a website
1:14
with this many pages just four pages
1:16
total is not going to rank above one
1:18
that has a lot of different pages that
1:19
talks about different services or has
1:21
blogs or talks about the different areas
1:23
that they serve so SEO not very good now
1:26
what about their lead capturing
1:27
mechanisms do they have any ways that
1:29
they can capture lead leads the only one
1:30
that I'm seeing here is this call now
1:32
button where somebody can call into the
1:34
business let's see if we click get a
1:36
quote right here that takes us to this
1:38
contact page which doesn't have a form
1:40
on it doesn't have really any way to
1:42
capture leads so I guess the only way
1:44
this website can capture leads is
1:45
through people calling them and then in
1:47
terms of overall design I mean you can
1:49
be the judge not very great right
1:51
they've got a couple different like fade
1:53
in elements and things like that but the
1:55
the overall layout does not look very
1:57
good great example of a not so good
2:00
website and going through Google you can
2:02
see how many people don't have websites
2:04
which are perfect candidates for us
2:06
selling our smart website offer as you
2:08
can see most businesses struggle with
2:10
what I like to call DWS dumb website
2:13
syndrome their websites don't rank on
2:14
Google it's not informational it's bad
2:16
at capturing leads and quite honestly it
2:18
just looks terrible but that's all right
2:20
because we can save the day by building
2:22
them a smart website for their business
2:24
instead here's an example of a smart
2:26
website that I'm currently working on
2:27
for one of my clients the first thing we
2:28
need to ask ourselves is the onpage SEO
2:31
good are we giving ourselves the best
2:32
chance of ranking at the top of Google
2:35
one thing we do on all of our smart
2:36
websites is we add individual service
2:38
pages for all of the keywords that our
2:40
client is trying to rank for so these
2:41
are all things that he offers when
2:43
people go to Google and type in lighting
2:44
control since we have a page
2:46
specifically dedicated to lighting
2:48
control that talks all about lighting
2:49
control it's keyword DSE which will send
2:52
really good signals to Google that we
2:54
are trying to rank for this keyword and
2:55
we'll rank at the top cuz we have a page
2:57
completely dedicated to just lighting
2:59
control along with all these other
3:00
services that this client offers so
3:02
that's one way we SEO optimize our
3:04
websites we also optimize the homepage
3:06
and everything for different keywords as
3:08
well but the second page is this
3:09
locations page we've added every
3:11
individual location for areas that this
3:13
client is trying to rank in so Idaho
3:14
Falls Rexburg rby we click on any one of
3:16
them and this talks about you know Idaho
3:18
Falls and the area that they serveice so
3:20
this also sends great signals to Google
3:22
that this is where our client is trying
3:24
to rank because we have individual pages
3:26
on our website for all and each of these
3:28
areas next up does our smart website
3:31
capture leads or does our website
3:32
capture leads we have a few different
3:34
ways that they can capture leads through
3:36
our smart websites this call now button
3:38
right here somebody clicks it while
3:39
they're on their mobile phone it'll just
3:40
directly call the business which makes
3:42
it super easy they don't even have to
3:43
type it out you just click on it and
3:45
it'll call this business so that's the
3:46
first way we can capture leads second
3:48
way is this chat widget down here at the
3:50
bottom right if someone has a quick
3:51
question maybe they don't want to call
3:52
quite yet they can put in their name
3:53
phone number and email and send a
3:55
message to this business and all these
3:56
messages will go to our client's cell
3:58
phone and he can respond to all them
4:00
from an app that we give them access to
4:01
that's connected to the smart website
4:03
and so they can go through the chat
4:05
widget right here and then we also have
4:06
a contact page if someone wants to go
4:08
and submit a formal form request they
4:10
can do that as well they can fill in
4:11
their full name email phone number the
4:13
services they need how we can help them
4:15
and they can submit this as well which
4:16
will also send a text to this business
4:18
owner as soon as this is filled out that
4:20
hey you've got a new lead reach out to
4:21
them respond back to them and then we
4:23
can also add a booking page here we
4:25
could add a booking page this customer
4:26
doesn't want a booking page we could put
4:28
a calendar directly on the site that
4:29
people can pick a day and time to come
4:31
in for an appointment they have to fill
4:32
in their name email and phone number at
4:34
the end and so this website is
4:35
definitely optimized for leads and so in
4:38
that aspect it is a smart website and
4:40
then last of all the design it just
4:41
depends on the client of what they're
4:43
looking for but basically you want to
4:45
match the logo you want to match the
4:46
color scheme of the business and you
4:47
just want to make it look good as you
4:49
scroll down the page this is definitely
4:51
better than the dumb website that we
4:53
looked at earlier from that other
4:54
landscaping company so just having a
4:56
clean looking design making sure the
4:58
page is easily digestible is very
5:00
important and is another component that
5:02
makes up our smart websites as you can
5:04
see a smart website checks off all the
5:06
boxes of what a website should do for a
5:08
business it has good SEO so it ranks
5:10
high on Google it's optimized for
5:12
capturing 90% of leads and it looks
5:15
better too so now you know what a smart
5:16
website is but what tools do we need to
5:18
set them up I use two different
5:20
softwares to set up these smart websites
5:21
for my clients but you can really get
5:23
away with just using one software if you
5:25
don't want to charge the full $497 per
5:28
month subscription the first an
5:29
absolutely necessary software is go high
5:32
level and that's where we build the
5:33
websites and the lead captures and set
5:35
up the automated lead follow-up and Ai
5:38
and the second software I use is called
5:39
search Atlas and this one has an AI
5:41
pixel that you can install on your
5:43
client's website and it does the
5:44
majority of their SEO on autopilot and
5:46
if you're just offering smart websites
5:48
without SEO then you only need the go
5:50
high Lev software and you can charge
5:52
your clients 1 to $3,000 setup fees plus
5:55
$197 per month but if you want to offer
5:58
smart websites with ongoing SEO to help
6:00
your customers rank higher on Google
6:02
then you can use go high level and
6:03
search Atlas and charge the same setup
6:05
fees but a higher monthly fee of $497 a
6:09
month or more go high level is $297 per
6:12
month for unlimited smart website
6:14
clients and the search Atlas SEO
6:15
software starts at $97 per month and
6:17
goes up from there the more clients you
6:19
get and if you're wanting to sign up for
6:20
go high level or search Atlas you can do
6:22
so with my 30-day free trial links down

6:30
Zoom calls with me per week access 50

6:36
grow your agency faster so now we've
6:38
covered the tools you'll need to
6:39
successfully run a smart website agency
6:41
but how do we actually build the
6:43
websites building out these smart
6:44
websites in gohigh level is super easy
6:46
you can go to the sites tab then under
6:48
websites we can go here and click new
6:50
website so you can either create your
6:51
websites from blank which it's a very
6:53
Dragon drop website builder very easy to
6:55
build them out from scratch but what's
6:57
even nicer is go high level has over a
6:59
th000 website templates that we can
7:00
choose from in different niches that are
7:03
already pre-built which just makes the
7:04
building of the website process so much
7:07
faster and easier we can send a few
7:09
options to our clients let's say our
7:11
client is a plumber we can type in
7:13
plumber there's two different Plumbing
7:15
options that we could send to them like
7:16
I said you can also build the websites
7:18
from scratch and you can customize these
7:20
templates and change whatever you want
7:21
on them but it makes it super easy to
7:23
build them out I've already got a
7:25
website template here for a barber shop
7:27
and I'll go ahead and open up the
7:29
barbershop website template let me
7:31
switch back to the homepage really quick
7:34
and so here's our Barbershop template as
7:35
you can see every individual element
7:37
this logo this headline this paragraph
7:39
you can just click on it and edit it
7:41
it's super easy very drag and drop you
7:43
can click the plus sign here there's all
7:44
these different elements you can add
7:46
headlines uh forms blogs images videos
7:50
so many different elements you can add
7:52
to the page and those lead captures that
7:54
I showed you on our smart website
7:55
earlier you can easily add like under
7:57
the contact page of this one if I switch
7:59
to the contact page we'll see that form
8:01
that pops up right here and we can build
8:03
these forms outside of the website
8:04
builder if we just go under the sites
8:06
Tab and then go up to forms we can build
8:08
these forms out and customize them right
8:10
here under the form Builder you can do
8:11
the same thing with the chat widget um
8:13
you can do the calendars the same way
8:14
and you can really customize them make
8:16
them look good and then you can embed
8:17
them onto the website very easily so now
8:19
you can capture all these leads and then
8:21
the last thing you can do is after the
8:23
leads are captured you can create
8:24
automations inside of go high level
8:26
that'll automatically follow up with
8:28
people after they book in a appointment
8:29
it'll text them send them text message
8:31
and email reminders um let me find that
8:33
one right here so automations that look
8:35
like this after appointments are booked
8:37
it will update the person in the
8:38
pipeline to the appointment book stage
8:40
it'll send them an email saying thanks
8:41
for booking a text message hey thanks
8:43
for booking your appointment for Monday
8:45
at 3 p.m. we'll see you then then 2
8:47
hours before the appointment it can send
8:48
another text and another email and then
8:51
2 hours after the appointment we can
8:52
automate a Google review request to send
8:55
out to their text to their phone and to
8:57
their email and so you can automate this
8:59
entire process for these businesses
9:01
whenever leads come in it can
9:02
automatically follow up with those leads
9:04
through text message email and um yeah
9:06
just really nurture them into clients
9:08
for these business owners a lot of these
9:10
business owners are really busy so
9:11
having these automations that'll
9:12
automatically follow up with every lead
9:14
will save them a ton of time and help
9:16
them convert their leads on autopilot
9:18
another thing we can do with our smart
9:19
websites is we can hook up an AI chatbot
9:22
to our chat widget so if we go back to
9:25
our website here go under websites and
9:27
then we go to our homepage you'll notice
9:29
these websites have these chat widgets
9:31
down here you can actually hook up a
9:33
live chat widget and it's AI so it'll
9:35
you train it and it'll respond back and
9:37
forth with the clients right here on
9:38
your website and so it's a really good
9:40
way to just help people without a human
9:42
actually having to go and spend their
9:44
time talking to people the AI chat Bots
9:46
can do everything for you and to the
9:48
website that we showed you earlier we
9:49
can set up an AI voice bot that when
9:52
people call in it'll answer the phone
9:54
talk to people answer their questions
9:56
and book them in for appointments and
9:57
just help them with whatever they need
9:59
and you can fully train these right
10:00
inside of go high level which is insane
10:02
and so truly is a smart website it has
10:05
AI connected to the phone number it has
10:07
AI connected to the chat widget it has
10:09
automations that are following up with
10:11
any leads that come through the contact
10:13
forms or these chat widgets you can set
10:15
it up whichever way you want but it'll
10:17
do all of the lead followup for your
10:18
clients on autopilot and then if you're
10:20
wanting to use the search Atlas software
10:22
to do ongoing SEO for your clients which
10:24
you can charge $497 for or more per
10:27
month I know people who are charging
10:28
$1,000 $1,500 $2,000 a month for this
10:31
ongoing SEO using search Atlas you can
10:33
simply go into the software you'll go to
10:35
this new auto SEO V2 and then you can
10:38
click create you can select from your
10:40
different websites and then click
10:42
continue fill in some basic information
10:44
about the business continue again and
10:46
then you can copy this pixel right here
10:47
so I'll go ahead and copy the pixel and
10:49
all you have to do is install this pixel
10:51
onto the go high Lev website under
10:52
settings and then right here under the
10:55
head tracking code you just paste that
10:57
in and click save and then the pixel
10:58
will be in installed on the website and
11:00
it'll do all of the backend SEO for your
11:02
website on autopilot there's just maybe
11:04
10 15 20 minutes of of work every month
11:07
that you have to do to check up on
11:09
things inside of search Atlas but other
11:11
than that it's a very very passive
11:13
service to offer that you can charge a
11:14
lot more money for on an ongoing monthly
11:17
basis as you can see go high level makes
11:19
building our smart websites Easy by
11:21
having everything in one place for us as
11:23
the agency owner and our clients can
11:25
manage everything from an app on their
11:27
phone go high level has a mobile app
11:28
called Le connector that our clients can
11:30
log into and manage all of their leads
11:33
conversations appointments Pipeline and
11:35
all their invoicing from one spot so now
11:37
you know how we build smart websites but
11:39
how do we price them for our clients
11:41
another reason that I love this offer is
11:42
because you can charge large setup fees
11:45
as well as monthly fees to keep
11:46
everything running for your client
11:48
here's the pricing I like to use for the
11:49
smart website offer we do $1,000 setup
11:52
fee for a three-page website that's just
11:54
a basic website a $2,000 setup fee for a
11:57
five-page website and then then a $3,000
12:00
setup fee for a 10 Page Plus website and
12:03
then the monthly fees down below go with
12:05
the features that are included so the
12:06
$97 per month plan they get SMS and
12:09
email automations they get onpage SEO
12:12
just basic onpage SEO Miss call text
12:14
back so when leads call them and they
12:16
don't answer the phone because they're
12:17
busy doing business it'll text those
12:19
leads back automatically so they're not
12:20
Miss Lead management app which is the
12:22
lead connector app that I talked about
12:24
earlier that they can manage their
12:25
entire website from then they get a
12:26
contact form and a chat widget on their
12:28
website to capture leads now we're
12:30
moving to the unlimited plan which is
12:32
197 per month this one includes
12:34
everything from the starter plan plus we
12:36
give them more advanced SMS and email
12:38
automations that send more text and more
12:40
emails than this one we give them a
12:41
Google review automation which will
12:43
automatically text their leads and email
12:45
them a Google review request after they
12:47
become a customer of the business and
12:49
then we have Payment Processing where
12:51
they can send invoices and process
12:53
payments using the app that we give them
12:55
access to that's connected to their
12:56
website and then also we give them the
12:58
calendar booking system so if they're
12:59
like a barber shop customers can go
13:01
directly to their website book their
13:03
haircut on the calendar and it will run
13:05
everything from there and then we have
13:07
this Pro Plan for $4.97 per month which
13:09
gives them everything from unlimited and
13:11
starter plus we hook up an AI chatbot to
13:14
their website that'll chat back and
13:16
forth with their customers plus the AI
13:17
voice spot when people call in it'll
13:19
answer the phone talk with them like a
13:21
real human and help them out then we do
13:23
ongoing SEO updates so on an ongoing
13:26
basis we will help them rank higher and
13:27
higher on Google so they can beat out
13:28
their competitors and then we give them
13:31
bonly marketing consultation calls so
13:33
two per month marketing calls so we can
13:35
just help them with whatever things
13:37
marketing related they need help with in
13:38
their business a pro tip for pricing
13:40
when you're first starting your agency
13:42
is you can remove the setup fees and
13:44
just charge monthly fees for your first
13:45
few clients to get practice delivering
13:47
the service that way you're giving your
13:49
clients a good deal but still making
13:51
some monthly income to cover your
13:53
subscription cost for go high level and
13:55
or search Atlas if you're using it now
13:56
you know what to charge your clients but
13:58
how do you actually get local businesses
13:59
to pay you for the smart websites over
14:02
the past few years running my agency I
14:03
found these three methods work the
14:05
absolute best for getting local Business
14:07
website clients the first method for
14:09
getting clients which works extremely
14:10
well it's how I've landed a large
14:12
portion of my clients is simply going to
14:14
Google Maps typing in your Niche that
14:15
you're trying to reach out to and then
14:17
near me you'll find almost unlimited
14:19
businesses doing this with different
14:21
niches right here on Google Maps each of
14:23
them when you click on it it has their
14:25
phone number it has their address you
14:27
have their information um but the cool
14:29
part about this is you can easily and
14:30
quickly see who has websites and who
14:32
doesn't so this one has a website this
14:34
one does but these first two don't you
14:35
can see there's no website symbol here
14:37
so these would be prime candidates to
14:39
reach out to and Pitch your services to
14:41
now even the ones that do have websites
14:43
if we click them and check them out
14:45
first before we give them a call this
14:46
one isn't even a website it's just a
14:48
Facebook page and then you know let's
14:50
click on this one I think this is the
14:51
one we clicked on earlier yeah this one
14:52
just looks bad and isn't really
14:54
optimized and it's definitely not a
14:55
smart website like the ones that we
14:57
offer even if they do have a website we
14:59
can still reach out to them we can still
15:01
pitch them on our smart website services
15:02
and the basic pitch you'll say for a
15:04
business that has no website is hey Mr
15:06
business owner this is Jasper with web
15:08
juice I noticed you didn't have a
15:10
website when we looked at your Google
15:11
business profile we actually built a new
15:13
one for you uh we build smart websites
15:15

15:18

brand would you be interested in
15:21

15:26
quick call either later today or

15:30

15:31
you can say hey Mr business owner we
15:33

15:34

15:36

15:38
more leads so same kind of pitch right
15:40
um but this time you're just saying hey
15:42

15:43
new and improved one um for your
15:45
business and you could throw in there
15:47
you know we build you a smart built you
15:48
a smart website so that's method number
15:50
one you basically have unlimited leads
15:52
using Google Maps right here the second
15:53
method if you're not as big into coal
15:55
calling is using local Facebook groups
15:57
this is a local Facebook group in my
15:59
area that I'm part of um rig Idaho it
16:01
has 18,000 members and these groups
16:04
allow self-promotion so you're allowed
16:06
to go in here and I'm allowed to type
16:08
hey I'm offering two websites for the
16:10
first two people that comment for no
16:12
setup fee just pay a monthly
16:14
subscription so these are your first
16:15
couple clients you can just wave the
16:16
setup fee and say hey I'm just doing it
16:18
for the hosting fee of the website which
16:20
is $97 a month but the setup fee is free
16:23
and then the third way to get clients is
16:25
to go to local Chamber of Commerce
16:27
events in your city or your town or go
16:29
to local BNI groups this is the local
16:32
Chamber of Commerce here in my area if
16:34
you go to events on their website you
16:35
can just type this in in any City you
16:37
can just type in whatever City you're in
16:39
Dallas Texas Chamber of Commerce it'll
16:41
come up with their website and I can go
16:42
to the events calendar on their website
16:44
and I can see different events that
16:46
they're holding let's see if it'll load
16:47
here here we go so on February 6th for
16:50
example they're doing a networking night
16:52
which is just going to be a bunch of
16:53
business owners that you can go chat
16:54
with and let them know hey I build these
16:56
smart websites are you guys looking to
16:58
get a new website done for your business
16:59
there's another one right here business
17:01
uh February business skills and
17:02
networking Forum 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.
17:05
so there's lots of different events
17:07
going on in your town that you might not
17:08
know about and they're all business
17:09
owners that are attending them so these
17:11
are all prime candidates of people that
17:13
we can offer these smart websites too
17:15
the three client getting methods that I
17:16
just showed you along with referrals and
17:18
posting social media content have been
17:20
the best ways hands down that I've been
17:22
able to get clients and grow my smart
17:24
website agency but even if you use these
17:26
proven methods to find clients getting
17:28
them to pay is a completely different
17:29
skill set and you're going to need to
17:31
learn how to close them so here's a
17:32
brief overview of the three-step closing
17:34
framework I use when doing sales calls
17:36
with potential clients step one I like
17:39
to call the discovery phase this is
17:40
where you ask your prospect questions
17:42
about their business and their current
17:43
website if they have one so you can get
17:45
a good idea of how you can help them
17:47
best questions like how are you
17:48
currently generating leads for your
17:50
business what do you love about your
17:52
current website what do you hate about
17:53
your current website what would be your
17:55
ideal goal for your online presence over
17:57
the next year these these questions give
17:59
us the info we need to better cater our
18:01
smart website offer and show them the
18:03
things about the new website that will
18:04
matter the most to them then I segue
18:06
into step two which is the information
18:08
stage this is where I present a rough
18:10
draft website example in their Niche
18:12
that we put together for them before the
18:14
call started this gives the prospect an
18:15
example of what our websites look like
18:17
and we can show how it will get them
18:19
ranked higher how it will capture leads
18:21
for them and how the AI Bots and
18:23
automated follow-up work and then we
18:24
move to phase three which is simply
18:26
showing them the different pricing
18:27
options and asking them which one they
18:29
want to move forward with but even if
18:30
you're the best salesperson in the world
18:32
you're going to get objections when you
18:34
get to the end of your sales calls so
18:36
here are the four most common objections
18:38
I get when selling smart websites and
18:39
how I overcome them objection number one
18:42
we already have a website whenever
18:43
people say this it's pretty easy to want
18:45
to just tell them why their website is
18:47
bad and how we can improve it but
18:49
definitely don't do that cuz it will
18:50
cause the prospect to get defensive what
18:52
I like to do instead is start asking
18:54
questions about their current website
18:55
ask how it's doing at generating leads
18:57
ask what they love or hate about the
18:59
current design of it ask how well it's
19:01
ranking on Google you can even offer to
19:03
do an audit on their site using the
19:04
search Atlas software that I mentioned
19:05
earlier which will show how their
19:07
website is performing with SEO asking
19:09
questions like this will help them
19:10
realize where their website lacks
19:12
instead of you just telling them how bad
19:14
it is objection number two it's too
19:16
expensive to overcome this one we have
19:18
two different options the first option I
19:20
like to ask them what their average
19:21
customer is worth to them and income to
19:23
their business if it's anything above
19:25
$500 then you can just tell them that
19:27
one extra customer per month will will
19:28
cover the cost of our services easily
19:30
and realistically our smart websites
19:32
will generate them more than just one
19:33
lead per month so it'll easily pay for
19:36
itself and the second option I like to
19:37
give for the price objection is by
19:39
offering them a payment plan or a fast
19:41
Action discount if they decide to move
19:43
forward with us today this will give
19:44
your client an easier way to stomach the
19:46
price of the smart website and create
19:48
some urgency for them to move forward
19:50
objection number three I'm not sure if
19:52
this will generate any leads for my
19:53
business so basically this one just
19:55
means they have trust issues no just
19:57
kidding but in this scenario I like to
19:59
ask the customer what proof would it
20:00
take for me to show you that you'll get
20:03
customers through our smart website and
20:04
then they'll just tell you what they
20:05
want to see to better trust your offer
20:07
and then you can show them the things
20:09
that they ask for you could show them
20:10
case studies testimonials from other
20:12
clients or just stats from Google that
20:14
prove this will help them get more leads
20:16
and objection number four I need to talk
20:17
to my wife and or business partner first
20:20
off why the hell aren't they on the call
20:21
in the first place you can always get
20:23
the decision maker on every call but if
20:25
this does come up then I like to say no
20:27
worries are they available to join the
20:29
call right now really quick or would it
20:30
be better to set up a follow-up meeting
20:32
with the both of you either option the
20:33
prospect picks is fine we either get to
20:35
talk to the other decisionmaker right
20:37
then or we set up another call for
20:39
another day and we can sell them then
20:40
other people might disagree with me on
20:42
this objection overcome and try to just
20:43
make the sale right there on the first
20:45
call with the one decision maker but
20:46
building smart websites is an offer
20:48
that's a long-term relationship and
20:50
these clients will hopefully be paying
20:51
you for years to come so you don't want
20:52
to pressure them too much and make them
20:54
feel uncomfortable so now you know the
20:55
entire formula of how I sell smart
20:57
websites to different different local
20:59
businesses but unfortunately I couldn't
