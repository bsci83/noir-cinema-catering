# Business Website Platform - White Label CMS

## Project Overview
This is a white-label website management platform that allows agencies, freelancers, and developers to manage multiple client websites from a single dashboard. Built as a SaaS product with recurring revenue model.

## Current Session Status (Last Updated: 2025-08-19)

### ✅ Completed Tasks
1. Created complete white-label platform structure
2. Built platform landing page (`PlatformLanding.tsx`)
3. Implemented admin dashboard with mock data
4. Created content editor interface for no-code updates
5. Set up authentication flow (mocked Firebase)
6. Successfully built production version
7. Installed Playwright MCP for browser automation

### 🎯 Next Tasks (Resume Here)
1. **Analyze SageAAA.com** - Use Playwright MCP to review the existing site
2. **Integrate platform into SageAAA offerings** - Create product page/section
3. **Connect real Firebase** - Replace mocked auth/database
4. **Deploy to production** - Set up at platform.sageaaa.com
5. **Create demo content** - Populate with sample clients

### ⚠️ Important Context
- **Playwright MCP is installed** but requires session restart to activate
- **Firebase is currently mocked** in `/src/lib/firebase.ts` 
- **Demo credentials**: admin@demo.com / demo123
- **White-Label folder** is separate from main noir-cinema-catering project

## Playwright MCP Setup (Already Installed)

### Configuration Files Created:
- `mcp.config.json` - MCP server configuration
- `playwright.config.ts` - Playwright test configuration  
- `tests/example.spec.ts` - Sample test file

### To Use Playwright MCP:
1. Start new Claude Code session in this directory
2. Playwright commands should be available
3. Can browse to any website for analysis

### Test Commands:
```bash
npm run test:e2e        # Run all tests
npm run test:e2e:ui     # Run with UI mode
npm run test:e2e:debug  # Debug tests
```

## Business Model
- **Platform Fee**: $297/month for unlimited clients
- **Agency Charges**: $97-297/month per client
- **Profit Example**: 50 clients × $97/mo = $4,850/mo revenue - $297 platform fee = $4,553/mo profit

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Testing**: Playwright + @playwright/mcp
- **Backend**: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage) - currently mocked for demo
- **Hosting**: Can deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or Cloudflare Pages

- Real-time preview
- Image upload capability
- Auto-save functionality

### 4. Multi-Tenant Architecture

- Centralized management

## Development Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Run Playwright tests
npm run test:e2e
```

## SageAAA Integration Plan

### Option 1: Subdomain Approach
- Deploy platform at `platform.sageaaa.com`
- Keep main site for custom dev services
- Clear separation of offerings

### Option 2: Product Page Integration
- Add `/platform` route to main site
- Include in main navigation
- Position as premium offering

### Option 3: Separate Brand
- Create new brand for platform
- SageAAA as the technology provider
- White-label to other agencies

### Recommended Marketing Copy:
```
"Turn Websites into Recurring Revenue"
- Manage unlimited client sites from one dashboard
- Charge $97-297/month per client
- We provide the tech, you keep the profits
```

## Deployment Options

### Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```

### Netlify
- Drag `dist` folder to netlify.com/drop

### Cloudflare Pages
```bash
npm run build
# Upload dist folder to Cloudflare Pages
```

## Firebase Setup (When Ready)

1. Create Firebase project
2. Enable Authentication (Email/Password)
3. Enable Firestore Database
4. Enable Storage
5. Update `/src/lib/firebase.ts` with your config:
```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-auth-domain",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-storage-bucket",
  messagingSenderId: "your-sender-id",
  appId: "your-app-id"
}
```

## Current Status
- ✅ Platform landing page complete
- ✅ Admin dashboard UI complete
- ✅ Content editor interface built
- ✅ Authentication flow ready
- ✅ Production build working
- ✅ Playwright MCP installed and configured
- ⚠️ Firebase currently mocked (needs real config)
- ⚠️ Demo credentials: admin@demo.com / demo123
- 🔄 Pending: SageAAA.com analysis and integration

## Revenue Strategy

### Positioning
- NOT "smart websites" or "AI websites"
- Positioned as "Business Website Platform"
- Targets agencies wanting recurring revenue
- Emphasizes ownership (vs GoHighLevel lock-in)

### Competitive Advantages
- Clients own their code
- No vendor lock-in
- Simple, transparent pricing
- 10-minute setup per client
- White-label ready

### Target Market
- Digital agencies
- Freelance developers  
- Marketing consultants
- Anyone managing multiple client sites

## Hosting Architecture Recommendation

### Don't Build Your Own Hosting!
Running servers is a distraction from the business. Use:

1. **Cloudflare Pages + Workers KV**
   - Free static hosting
   - $5/mo for dynamic content
   - Global CDN included
   - 99.99% uptime

2. **Firebase/Supabase**
   - $0-25/month for dozens of sites
   - Real-time updates
   - Auth included
   - Auto-scaling

3. **Vercel/Netlify**
   - $20/month team accounts
   - Unlimited sites
   - Automatic deployments
   - CDN included

## Next Steps

1. **Restart session with Playwright MCP** to analyze SageAAA.com
2. **Set up Firebase project** with real credentials
3. **Deploy to production** (Vercel/Netlify/Cloudflare)
4. **Create marketing site** at main domain
5. **Platform lives at** platform.sageaaa.com
6. **Start selling** to agencies at $297/month

## Important Notes

- The platform is designed to be white-labeled
- Agencies can charge their own prices to clients
- You provide the technology, they provide the service
- Focus on recurring revenue, not one-time sales
- This is a B2B2B model (you → agencies → businesses)
- Playwright MCP installed for browser automation and testing

## Support & Maintenance

- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor Firebase usage/costs
- Add features based on agency feedback
- Consider adding:
  - Blog/news posting system
  - Email campaign integration
  - Social media scheduling
  - A/B testing features
  - Advanced analytics

## Business Metrics to Track

- MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
- Client churn rate
- Average revenue per agency
- Time to first client (onboarding)
- Support ticket volume
